## Technical Details

### Scripting Language

JavaScript is a **scripting language**, which means:

- ✅ **Interpreted** - runs exactly as you write it
- ✅ **Dynamic** - types are determined at runtime
- ✅ **High-level** - abstracts away complex details
- ❌ **Not compiled** (like C++ or Java)

### Benefits of Scripting

1. **See your exact code** - what you write is what runs
2. **Easy debugging** - inspect code directly in browser
3. **Fast development** - no build/compile waiting
4. **Immediate feedback** - run code instantly

## Key Takeaway

JavaScript is the **universal language of the web** and beyond. Learning JavaScript opens doors to:

- Frontend development
- Backend development
- Mobile development
- Desktop applications
