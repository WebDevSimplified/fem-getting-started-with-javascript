<!-- TODO: Maybe mention in the workshop (or on some page) that students should feel free to experiment as I am talking and/or pause the video to experiment with the different things I talk about since nothing beats trying it out yourself. If they ever have the question of "I wonder how this works" encourage them to try it themselves to experiment with it instead of asking AI or Googling it. -->

# Learning JavaScript is Hard

JavaScript isn't the hardest language to learn, but it also isn't the easiest. It doesn't matter what language you choose, learning to code is a challenge. JavaScript in particular has many complexities that can make it feel overwhelming which we will be covering through this workshop.

## Why JavaScript Feels Overwhelming

1. Constant Evolution

   Web development changes fast → JavaScript changes even faster

2. Multiple Ways to Do Everything

   - Legacy ways
   - Modern ways
   - Hacks and workarounds
   - Framework-specific methods
   - 3rd party libraries

3. Information Overload

   Hard to know:

   - What's the best technique?
   - What's old vs. new?
   - What should I actually use?

## Our Workshop Approach

**Reality Check:** We can't cover everything in one day.

**Our Goal:** Solid foundation + confidence to build projects.

**Today's Focus:**

- Core fundamentals only
- Modern JavaScript
- Hands-on practice
- Foundation for continued learning

## Workshop Goals

By the end of today:

✅ **Understand** how JavaScript works  
✅ **Write** basic JavaScript programs  
✅ **Debug** simple issues  
✅ **Feel confident** starting projects

## What We Cover vs. Don't Cover

### ✅ **We Will Cover**

- Core concepts for every JS project
- Modern syntax and best practices
- Hands-on exercises
- Real examples to build upon

### ❌ **We Won't Cover**

- Every JavaScript feature
- Advanced frameworks
- Complex algorithms
- Production deployment

## Key Mindset

1. **Overwhelm is normal** - too much to learn at once
2. **Foundation first** - core concepts only
3. **This is your starting point** - not the finish line
4. **Practice makes progress** - engage with exercises

**Bottom Line:** JavaScript is complex, but you **can** start building today!
