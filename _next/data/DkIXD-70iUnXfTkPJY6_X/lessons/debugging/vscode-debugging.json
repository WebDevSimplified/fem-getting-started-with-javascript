You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and control execution flow all within the same interface where you write your code.\n\nThe core debugging concepts (breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection) are the same as covered in the Sources Tab lesson, but VSCode provides a more streamlined experience for certain types of development.\n\n## Setting Up JavaScript Debugging\n\nBy default, VSCode supports debugging Node.js and browser applications. Here's how to get started:\n\n1. Open the \"Run and Debug\" sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D).\n2. Click \"Create a launch.json file\".\n3. Select \"Node.js\" or \"Web App (Chrome)\" depending on your application type.\n4. VSCode generates a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder with default configurations.\n5. Modify the `launch.json` as needed for your project.\n   - Changing the URL port for web apps is usually all you need to do.\n\n```json\n// Default launch.json for \"Web App (Chrome)\"\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"chrome\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"name\": \"Launch Chrome against localhost\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:8080\", // Change this to your app's URL\n      \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Launching the Debugger\n\nOnce you have your `launch.json` set up all you need to do is click the green play button in the debug sidebar or press F5. This will start the debugging session and launch your application in the browser or Node.js environment.\n\n## Creating Breakpoints\n\nYou can set breakpoints in VSCode by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers in your code editor.
